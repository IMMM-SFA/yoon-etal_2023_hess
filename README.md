## Abstract
Large-scale hydrological models (LHMs) are commonly used for regional and global assessment of future water shortage outcomes under climate and socioeconomic scenarios. The irrigation of croplands, which accounts for the lion’s share of human water consumption, is critical in understanding these water shortage trajectories. Despite irrigation’s defining role, LHM frameworks typically impose trajectories of land use that underlie irrigation demand, neglecting potential dynamic feedbacks in the form of human instigation of and subsequent adaptation to water shortage via irrigated crop area changes. We extend an LHM, MOSART-WM, with adaptive farmer agents, applying the model to the Continental United States to explore water shortage outcomes that emerge from the interplay between hydrologic-driven surface water availability, reservoir management, and farmer irrigated crop area adaptation. The extended modeling framework is used to conduct hypothetical computational experiment comparing differences between a model run with and without the incorporation of adaptive farmer agents. These comparative simulations reveal that accounting for farmer adaptation via irrigated crop area changes substantially alters modeled water shortage outcomes, with U.S.-wide annual water shortage reduced by as much as 42 percent when comparing adaptive and non-adaptive versions of the model forced with U.S. climatology from 1950-2009.

## Reproduce my figures
Reproduce my figures:

The figures for the manuscript are generated based on post-processing of MOSART-WM-ABM output files in Python, Tableau, QGIS, and Inkscape. The WM-ABM working directory contains two general types of output files: 1) monthly netCDF output files with the MOSART-WM results (e.g., river flows, water demand, water shortage, etc.) and, 2) csv files containing annual ABM results (crop types, crop areas, etc.). The general steps are laid out below:

__1.__ The monthly netCDF files are post-processed into a consolidated csv file using the "WM_output_PIC_ncdf.py" script. The script reads in monthly the MOSART-WM netCDF files, calculates various annual summary statistics (e.g., average supply for each cell by year), saves the summary statistics into a pandas dataframe, and finally outputs the pandas dataframe as a csv (e.g., "wm_summary_results.csv").

__2.__ The "abm_output_processing.py" script is used to further post-process output, taking the annual abm output csv files and the wm summary file generated in __[1]__ above as inputs.

__3.__ Figure 2a is generated based upon taking post-processed output from __[2]__ and developing the final visualizations in Tableau. Final touch ups (e.g., drought labels) are added in Inkscape.

__4.__ Figure 2b is generated based upon taking post-processed output from __[2]__ and generating the final maps in QGIS. A Stamen Terrain Background map is used for the visualization using QuickMapServices in QGIS. Final touch ups (e.g., modification of label locations) are conducted in Inkscape.

__5.__ The crop area bump charts (left side) of Figure 3 are generated based upon taking post-processed output from __[2]__ and developing the final visualizations in Tableau. See guide here: http://www.datatableauandme.com/2017/08/how-to-area-bump-chart-in-tableau.html

__6.__ The shortage and adaptivity maps (right side) of Figure 3 are generated taking post-processed output from __[2]__ and developing the final visualizations in QGIS with final touch ups conducted in Inkscape.

__7.__ Figure 4 is generated based upon taking post-processed output from __[2]__ and developing the final visualizations in Tableau. Final touch ups (e.g., drought labels) are added in Inkscape.

__8.__ Figure 1 is developed in Powerpoint and does not rely on any data inputs
